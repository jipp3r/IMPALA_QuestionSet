# IMPALA Question Set

## Background
Respiratory disease is a major cause of illness, disability and death. These tools have been designed for use in sub-Saharan Africa, where disease burdens are extremely high. They allow researchers a standardized set of questions to enumerate the symptoms of respiratory disease, and the risk factors for respiratory ill-health.

These questionnaires have not yet been fully field-evaluated, but a description of the process by which they were created can be found at http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/8/1615

## Required
This question set has been produced using the XLSForm template (an Excel representation of XForms). XForms can be used with Enketo, KoboToolbox, ODK and other packages. The choice of which platform to use is yours.


## Includes
This collection of questionnaires include:
* IMPALA_Symptoms - for assessment of respiratory symptoms.
* IMPALA_Energy - for enumeration of household sources of air pollution, including cookstove use
* IMPALA_LifeExposures - for assessment of other air pollution at work and in the home
* IMPALA_Nutrition - Based on the Global Asthma Network nutrition questions, this abbreviated tool gives semi-quantitative assessment of food group intake
* IMPALA_Smoking - for enumeration of first hand tobacco exposure (second-hand smoke exposure is contained within the LifeExposures question set.
* IMPALA_TB - for enumeration of previous tuberculosis treatments and their outcomes.
